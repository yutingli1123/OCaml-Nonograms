# COMP-302 Project: Nonograms

## Team Members
- **Yuting Li**
- **Christopher Leclerc**
- **Vincent Boucher**

## Project Overview
This project is a part of the COMP-302 course requirements, where our team will implement **Nonograms** in the OCaml programming language. Nonograms, also known as Hanjie, Paint by Numbers, Picross, Griddlers, and Pic-a-Pix, are picture logic puzzles in which cells in a grid must be colored or left blank according to numbers at the edges of the grid to reveal a hidden picture. In this puzzle, the numbers are a form of discrete tomography that measures how many unbroken lines of filled-in squares there are in any given row or column.

## Objective
Our goal is to design and implement a program in OCaml that can solve Nonogram puzzles using backtracking and constraint satisfaction algorithms.

## Development Environment
- **Language**: OCaml
- **OCaml Version**: 5.2.0 or above
